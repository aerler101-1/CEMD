## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aerler101-1/CEMD.git
   cd CEMD
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìà Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

To explore the analysis in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open `CEMD.ipynb`.

### Running the Streamlit App

To launch the interactive dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local web server and open the app in your default web browser (typically at `http://localhost:8501`).
